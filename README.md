## Introduction

Python is a versatile programming language that can be used for many applications. In this repository, I aim to share my journey through various Python projects. Each project serves as a learning experience and demonstrates different aspects of programming with Python.

## Topics Covered

This repository includes projects that utilize the following topics:

- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for building web applications.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computations in Python.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
- **Plotly**: A library for creating interactive visualizations.
- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **Python3**: The latest version of Python.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: A tool for automating web applications.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight database engine.
- **Tkinter**: A standard GUI toolkit for Python.
- **Turtle**: A fun way to introduce programming concepts.

## Projects Overview
